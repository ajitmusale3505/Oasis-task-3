# Data Cleaning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential part of data analysis, and demonstrating data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. This project involves applying various data cleaning techniques to ensure high-quality datasets.

## ðŸš€ Key Concepts and Challenges
1. **Data Integrity**
   - Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the cleaning process.
   
2. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.
   
3. **Duplicate Removal**
   - Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.
   
4. **Standardization**
   - Applying consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.
   
5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning techniques.
- Develop skills in handling missing data, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
- Learn to standardize and preprocess datasets for better analytical outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights
- Improved dataset quality by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- Ensured data accuracy and integrity for better analysis.
- Provided a clean dataset ready for further analytical tasks or machine learning models.
